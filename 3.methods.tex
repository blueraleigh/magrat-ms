\subsection{Overview}

We first review generalized parsimony as it applies to a single gene tree
\cite{Sankoff_1975, Sankoff_Rousseau_1975}. For each node $u$ we maintain
three cost functions. The \textit{node cost} function $g_u(x)$ assigns a cost 
to each geographic state $x$ that gives the minimum cost required to explain 
the observed geographic states of all sample nodes whose most recent common 
ancestor is $u$ when $u$ is in state  $x$. If $u$ is a sample node, we set 
$g_u(x) = 0$ if $x = x_u$ and $g_u(x) = \infty$ if $x \neq x_u$. When $u$ is 
not a sample node $g_u$ is formed by the sum of the \textit{stem cost} 
functions of its children.

The stem cost function for a node $u$ is given by
%
$h_u(x) = \min_z \bigl[ \Delta_u(x, z) + g_u(z) \bigr]$.
%
The function $\Delta_u(x, z)$ assigns a cost to the transition from state $x$ to
state $z$ over the branch leading to node $u$. Here, we assume that $\Delta_u$
can be factored as:
%
$\Delta_u(x,z) = \phi(\tau_u) * \Delta(x,z)$,
%
where $\tau_u$ is the length of the branch leading to node $u$ and $\Delta$ is
a time-independent transition cost function. Typical choices for the
time-dependent component are $\phi(\tau_u) = \frac{1}{\tau_u}$ or 
$\phi(\tau_u) = 1$, the latter making the whole cost function independent of
branch lengths. We note that the minimum cost ancestor location assignments
produced by a parsimony reconstruction can be viewed as a maximum posterior
probability reconstruction when the cost function $\Delta_u$ is proportional 
to the negative logarithm of the lineage transition probability of a stochastic
dispersal process \cite{Maddison_1991}.

The node cost and stem cost functions can be computed in a single post-order
tree traversal. A second pre-order tree traversal can then be used to compute
the \textit{final cost} functions for each node. The final cost $f_u(x)$
gives the minimum cost required to explain the observed geographic states of
\emph{all} sample nodes when $u$ is in state $x$. When $u$ is the root of the
tree $f_u(x) = g_u(x)$. Otherwise, 
%
$f_u(x) = \min_z \bigl[ f_{\pi_u}(z) - h_u(z) + \Delta_u(z,x) + g_u(x) \bigr]$,
%
where $\pi_u$ represents the immediate ancestor of node $u$.

To sample a most parsimonious dispersal history we first choose a state at the
root of the tree that minimizes the final cost function. We then recurse through 
the tree in a pre-order traversal and for each node $u$ we choose a state
$x_u = \min_x \bigl[\Delta_u(x_{\pi_u}, x) + g_u(x)\bigr]$. Depending on the
nature of the geographic state space and cost function there may be multiple
(sometimes many) most parsimonious dispersal histories. Alternatively, if we
are not interested in only the most parsimonious histories we could instead 
choose a state for node $u$ with probability 
$\mathbb{P}(X_u = x | X_{\pi_u} = x_{\pi_u}) \propto \exp{\bigl[-\Delta_u(x_{\pi_u}, x) - g_u(x)\bigr]}$.

\subsection{Algorithm}

In this section we describe how we use the succinct tree sequence encoding
\cite{Kelleher_etal_2016} to efficiently compute node cost and stem cost 
functions for each marginal genealogy. Under the coalescent with recombination 
nearby gene trees are highly correlated. Moving between adjacent marginal trees 
requires only a small number of subtree-prune-and-regraft (SPR) operations. By 
keeping an index of the edges involved in these SPR operations and the order in 
which they need to be applied, the succinct tree sequence encoding allows us to 
efficiently maintain the state of parsimony calculations as we iterate over the 
marginal genealogies.

A detailed description of the tree sequence data structure can be found in
\cite{Kelleher_etal_2016}. For our purposes it suffices to know that
relationships among nodes are recorded in the edge table $E$. Each row in the
edge table records an ancestor-descendant relationship, and the indices of nodes
involved in that relationship can be accessed as $E[k].\texttt{parent}$ and 
$E[k].\texttt{child}$. The relationship encoded by an edge applies to the
half-open genomic between $E[k].\texttt{left}$ (inclusive) and
$E[k].\texttt{right}$ (exclusive). As we move along the genome from left to
right, the index vectors $I$ and $O$ give the insertion and
removal order of the edges needed to build each marginal gene tree topology 
(recorded in the vector $\pi$). The following algorithm is a modification of
the branch statistic algorithm that appears in \cite{Ralph_etal_2020}.

\subsection{Implementation}

Implementation of the generalized parsimony algorithm detailed above depends on
a choice of cost function $\Delta$, which in turn depends on the nature of the
geographic state space.

For a continuous two-dimensional state space we use the squared Euclidean
distance as the transition cost, which leads to node, stem, and final
costs that are quadratic functions of the spatial locations. The parameters
of these functions can be computed in constant time as we traverse each
genealogy \cite{Maddison_1991}.

For a finite set of geographic locations we require a matrix specifying the 
cost of transitions between all pairs of geographic states. In that case, the
node, stem, and final costs are discrete functions on the set of geographic
locations, and computing their values scales with the square of the number of
geographic locations.
