\subsection{Overview}

We first review generalized parsimony as it applies to a single gene tree
\citep{Sankoff_1975, Sankoff_Rousseau_1975}. For each node $u$ we maintain
three cost functions. The \textit{node cost} function $g_u(x)$ assigns a cost 
to each geographic state $x$ that gives the minimum cost required to explain 
the observed geographic states of all sample nodes whose most recent common 
ancestor is $u$ when $u$ is in state  $x$. If $u$ is a sample node, we set 
$g_u(x) = 0$ if $x = x_u$ and $g_u(x) = \infty$ if $x \neq x_u$. When $u$ is 
not a sample node $g_u$ is formed by the sum of the \textit{stem cost} 
functions of its children.

The stem cost function for a node $u$ is given by
%
$h_u(x) = \min_z \bigl[ \Delta_u(x, z) + g_u(z) \bigr]$.
%
The function $\Delta_u(x, z)$ assigns a cost to the transition from state $x$ to
state $z$ over the branch leading to node $u$. Here, we assume that $\Delta_u$
can be factored as:
%
$\Delta_u(x,z) = \phi(\tau_u) * \Delta(x,z)$,
%
where $\tau_u$ is the length of the branch leading to node $u$ and $\Delta$ is
a time-independent transition cost function. Typical choices for the
time-dependent component are $\phi(\tau_u) = \frac{1}{\tau_u}$ or 
$\phi(\tau_u) = 1$, the latter making the whole cost function independent of
branch lengths.

The node cost and stem cost functions can be computed in a single post-order
tree traversal. A second pre-order tree traversal can then be used to compute
the \textit{final cost} functions for each node. The final cost $f_u(x)$
gives the minimum cost required to explain the observed geographic states of
\emph{all} sample nodes when $u$ is in state $x$. When $u$ is the root of the
tree $f_u(x) = g_u(x)$. Otherwise, 
%
$f_u(x) = \min_z \bigl[ f_{\pi_u}(z) - h_u(z) + \Delta_u(z,x) + g_u(x) \bigr]$,
%
where $\pi_u$ represents the immediate ancestor of node $u$.

To sample a most parsimonious dispersal history we first choose a state at the
root of the tree that minimizes the final cost function. We then recurse through 
the tree in a pre-order traversal and for each node $u$ we choose a state
$x_u = \arg\min_x \bigl[\Delta_u(x_{\pi_u}, x) + g_u(x)\bigr]$. Depending on the
nature of the geographic state space and cost function there may be multiple
(sometimes many) most parsimonious dispersal histories. We note that the 
minimum cost ancestor location assignments produced by a parsimony 
reconstruction can be viewed as a maximum posterior probability reconstruction 
when the cost function $\Delta_u$ is proportional to the negative logarithm of 
the lineage transition probability of a stochastic dispersal process 
\citep{Maddison_1991}.

%Alternatively, if we are not interested in only the most parsimonious histories 
%we could instead choose a state for node $u$ with probability 
%$\mathbb{P}(X_u = x | X_{\pi_u} = x_{\pi_u}) \propto \exp{\bigl[-\Delta_u(x_{\pi_u}, x) - g_u(x)\bigr]}$.

\subsection{Algorithm}

In this section we describe how we use the succinct tree sequence encoding
\citep{Kelleher_etal_2016} to efficiently compute node cost and stem cost 
functions for each marginal genealogy. Under the coalescent with recombination 
nearby gene trees are highly correlated. Moving between adjacent marginal trees 
requires only a small number of subtree-prune-and-regraft (SPR) operations. By 
keeping an index of the edges involved in these SPR operations and the order in 
which they need to be applied, the succinct tree sequence encoding allows us to 
efficiently maintain the state of parsimony calculations as we iterate over the 
marginal genealogies.

A detailed description of the tree sequence data structure can be found in
\citet{Kelleher_etal_2016}. For our purposes it suffices to know that
relationships among all $N$ nodes in the tree sequence are recorded in the edge 
table $E$. Each row in the edge table records an ancestor-descendant
relationship, and the indices of nodes involved in that relationship can be 
accessed as $E[k].\texttt{parent}$ and  $E[k].\texttt{child}$. The relationship 
encoded by an edge applies to the half-open genomic between $E[k].\texttt{left}$ 
(inclusive) and $E[k].\texttt{right}$ (exclusive). As we move along the genome 
from left to right, the index vectors $I$ and $O$ give the insertion and
removal order of the edges needed to build each marginal gene tree topology 
(recorded in the vector $\pi$). The following algorithm is a modification of
the branch statistic algorithm that appears in \citep{Ralph_etal_2020}.

\begin{description}

        Then,
        if $u$ is a sample node and $x \neq x_u$,
            set $g_u(x) \leftarrow \infty$.

        $k \leftarrow k + 1$.
        Then,
        if $w \neq -1$,
            set $g_w(x) \leftarrow g_w(x) - h_u(x)$.
        Finally,
        set $g_u(x) \leftarrow g_u(x) - h_v(x)$,

        if $w \neq -1$
            set $g_w(x) \leftarrow g_w(x) - h_u(x)$.
        Then set
        $h_v(x) \leftarrow \min_{z}\bigl[\Delta_v(x,z) + g_v(z)\bigr]$,
        $g_u(x) \leftarrow g_u(x) + h_v(x)$,

        Then,
        if $w \neq -1$,
            set $g_w(x) \leftarrow g_w(x) - h_u(x)$.
        Then set
        $h_v(x) \leftarrow \min_{z}\bigl[\Delta_v(x,z) + g_v(z)\bigr]$.
        Finally,
        set $g_u(x) \leftarrow g_u(x) + h_v(x)$,
        $\pi_v = u$,
        $v \leftarrow u$,
        $u \leftarrow w$.

\item[S8.] [Update node and stem costs.]

            set $g_w(x) \leftarrow g_w(x) - h_u(x)$.
        Then
        set $h_v(x) \leftarrow \min_{z}\bigl[\Delta_v(x,z) + g_v(z)\bigr]$,

        $H_u(x) \leftarrow H_u(x) + s * \frac{h_u(x) - H_u(x)}{s_u}$,
        $F_u(x) \leftarrow F_u(x) + s * \frac{f_u(x) - F_u(x)}{s_u}$.

\item[S11.] [Tree loop tail.]
    Go to S2.

\end{description}

We begin in S1 by initializing the cost functions for each node to zero except in
the case of sample nodes, where we set them to positive infinity for all states
not equal to the observed state. We then set the parent of each node to minus
one (signifying the null element) so that the initial state of the tree sequence
is a forest of disconnected nodes. The average cost functions (denoted by the
corresponding capital letters) are also initialized to zero as these will be
updated as we iterate over the tree sequence.

The meat of the algorithm occurs in steps S4 and S5 of the edge removal loop
and in steps S8 and S9 of the edge insertion loop. Removal of an edge from
node $u$ to $v$ will alter the node and stem cost functions along the path from
$u$ back to the root of the genealogy. Step S4 prepares for this by first
substracting the stem costs of $u$ and $v$ from the node costs of their
respective parents. In step S5, we walk back along the path from $u$'s parent to
the root and recompute new stem costs and node costs given the updated node
costs at the head of the path. Insertion of an edge from node $u$ to $v$ will 
similarly alter the node and stem cost functions along the path from
$u$ back to the root of the genealogy. Step S7 prepares for this by first
substracting the stem cost of $u$ from the node cost of its parent and then
computing the stem cost of $v$ and adding it to the node cost of $u$. In step 
S8, we walk back along the path from $u$'s parent to the root as before and 
recompute new stem costs and node costs given the updated node costs at the 
head of the path.

Upon reaching step S9 we have finished constructing the tree together with its
node cost and stem cost functions. We record the genomic span of the tree in the 
variable $s$, which will be the weight applied to the current tree in the weighted
average. In S10 we perform a preorder traversal of the newly constructed tree
and compute the final cost function for each node. At the same time, we 
increment the total weight $s_u$ of each node by $s$ and update the weighted 
averages $G_u(x)$, $H_u(x)$, $F_u(x)$ with the cost functions for the current 
tree.

Correctness of the algorithm requires that edges are removed in order of 
nondecreasing right genomic coordinate and decreasing time and that edges are
inserted in order of nondecreasing left genomic coordinate and increasing time
(time is measured backward from the present). We assume that the index vectors
$I$ and $O$ are constructed to satisfy these conditions, and these assumptions 
form the basis of the conditional checks in steps S3 and S6 for determining
when to exit the edge removal and insertion loops.

\subsection{Implementation}

Implementation of the generalized parsimony algorithm detailed above depends on
a choice of cost function $\Delta$, which in turn depends on the nature of the
geographic state space.

For a continuous state space we use the squared Euclidean distance as the 
transition cost, which leads to node, stem, and final costs that are quadratic 
functions of the spatial locations. The parameters of these functions can be 
computed in constant time as we traverse each genealogy \citep{Maddison_1991}.

For a finite set of geographic locations we require a matrix specifying the 
cost of transitions between all pairs of geographic states. In that case, the
node, stem, and final costs are discrete functions on the set of geographic
locations, and computing their values scales with the square of the number of
geographic locations \citep{Clemente_etal_2009}.

\subsection{Simulation study}

We tested performance of the method using spatially explicit forward-time 
simulations with the software SLiM \citep{Haller_Messer_2019}. For each set of 
simulations described below we evaluated the ability of genome-wide parsimony 
averages to accurately estimate migration rates and the locations of genetic 
ancestors.
