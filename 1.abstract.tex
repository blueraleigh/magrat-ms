Geographic space is important for determining population genetic relationships.
If we knew where all our genetic ancestors were, we could, in principle, know 
patterns of dispersal across space and through time. Here, we describe a 
parsimony method for inferring locations of genetic ancestors and rates of 
geographic spread from estimated genome-wide genealogies. Our method, which 
relies on recent advancements in the inference and storage of genetic tree 
sequences, is computationally efficient, and is applicable for continuous and 
discrete representations of geographic space. We test the method using 
spatially explicit forward-time simulations.  We then apply the method to a 
continental dataset of humans, for which we are able to describe the geographic 
history of dispersal across the recent and distant past.
