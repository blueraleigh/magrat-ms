represents a single simulation generated under Laplace dispersal with kernel
variance given on the x-axis and a parsimonious genome-wide estimate of that
variance on the y-axis. Estimates were conducted under three levels of 
discretization (see main text) that are indistinguishable from one another on
the graph.

represents a single genetic ancestor. Ancestor location error is measured as
the distance between the estimated and the true location divided by the greatest
distance separating any pair of samples. Warm colors signify a greater density
of points.

samples. Every ancestor in the tree sequence is assigned a probability distribution 
over the set of grid cells reflecting its likely location. Each grid cell is 
colored by the weighted average of the ages of all genetic ancestors. Dark grey 
cells are omitted from the age distribution because the total weight of ancestors 
assigned to those cells is less than 1.}
